Someone once told me that if you do something for at least five years and it does not work out, it is okay to walk away and try something else. At the end of my five-year mark as a medical assistant I knew without a doubt that this was the perfect time for me to explore other career options. I had known halfway through my two-year degree program that this was not the career for me. But because of a little promise I made to myself back in 2011 I endured through it. I had vowed to myself that I would always finish what I start, no matter what. This made me take careful consideration before making any decisions because once I am in I am all in. So, I finished the degree program and worked in outpatient clinics for a little over five years. Even though I did not want to be a medical assistant I still gave it my all and that is always fulfilling but it just was not enough for me. So, with the love and support from my fianc√© and family I was able to take some much-needed time off. I took this time to relax and focus on myself, a spiritual retreat. I planned a trip to India to get my yoga teacher certification but I missed my flight due to a series of unfortunate events that we will discuss later. I cried like a baby about my journey of a lifetime being put on hold. After honoring my feelings and letting my ego run wild I quickly returned to my usual state of bliss.

I had planned to be in India for a month so I took this time to continue working on learning to build a website and blog of my own. I desire to share my passion for yoga, nature, herbs, and code has been added to that list now. In fact, code has taken over the number one spot. I knew a bootcamp would be a great option for me to help the transition of switching careers easier. It is more fun than work for me. I love challenges and problem solving. I had finally found the perfect career for me. I began my research by reading books, watching YouTube videos, and eventually enrolled in a free code boot camp that led me here. Although I am just beginning I know that this has been the best choice I have made for myself in a very long time. Everything fell into place effortlessly. Who needs a five-year rule when you are doing something that you are entirely obsessed with.
